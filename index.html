                <p>Selena began her career as a child actress starring on the children's television series Barney & Friends. As a recording artist, she signed with Hollywood Records in 2008 and formed the pop rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene. With three studio albums and seven singles, each of the band's releases have received gold certifications or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Further pursuing a career as a soloist, Gomez found continued success with her solo studio albums, as each debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her EDM-inspired debut, Stars Dance (2013) yielded the international top-ten single "Come & Get It". Desiring more artistic control, Gomez signed with Interscope Records to release the electropop set Revival (2015), supported by the top-ten singles "Good for You", "Same Old Love", and "Hands to Myself". Its follow-up, Rare (2020), topped the charts in various countries, and was led by Gomez's first US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single "Lose You to Love Me". She forayed into Spanish-language music with the EP Revelación (2021), which earned her career-first Grammy and Latin Grammy Award nominations. Gomez has also released various collaborative singles, including "We Don't Talk Anymore", "It Ain't Me", "Wolves", "Taki Taki", and "Calm Down (Remix)"; the latter became the most commercially successful afrobeats song of all time and the best-selling collaboration of 2023 globally.</p>
